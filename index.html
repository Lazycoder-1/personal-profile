    <p>My Journey as an Aspiring Developer</p>
    <p>
          
I am an enthusiastic and determined beginner in the world of web development. Hailing from the vibrant city of Shenzhen, China, I recently discovered my passion for creating websites and bringing ideas to life through code.  

Currently, I am diving into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, dedicating myself to building a strong foundation in web development. I love experimenting with small projects, from crafting simple personal webpages to designing interactive features.  

Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring creative design ideas, watching tech tutorials, and connecting with fellow learners. Eager to grow my skills and contribute to exciting projects, I am on a journey to turn my curiosity into expertise.  

My favorite motto: *"Every great developer was once a beginner."*
